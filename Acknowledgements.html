<!--  l. 1  --><p class="noindent">My interest in physics was ignited in the 10th grade by the discovery of the Higgs boson
                                                                                

                                                                                
and Stephen Hawking’s <i>The Universe in a Nutshell</i>. These past five years,
dedicated to understanding the Higgs and the mysteries of our early universe, have
been a fulfillment of dreams then born and will be a part of my life I cherish
forever.
</p><!--  l. 4  --><p class="indent">       I have many people to thank for allowing my childhood passion to flourish into
this dissertation. I start first and foremost with my parents and little Kli for their love
and support at every step. I thank as well my entire extended family for making me feel
at home around the world, from Delhi to Pondicherry and California to Texas. I am
especially grateful to all my grandparents, whose wisdom, selflessness, and memory
inspire me always.
</p><!--  l. 9  --><p class="indent">       I would not have survived this PhD — particularly the two long years of
lockdown and two long quarters of E&amp;M, without my amazing friends, old and new, in
San Diego: Aneesh, Biswa, Chris, Davide, Dro, Elliot, Gerald, Hulk, and Varun (to
name a few). I thank as well my fellow CMS students, Farouk and Yanxi, with whom I
moved across continents and conducted an ancillary PhD in ping pong. Along
with them, I thank my friends in Geneva and Chicago, including Fifi, Jay,
Priyanka, and the LPC crew, for making my two years working at CERN and
Fermilab so memorable. Most of all, I thank Praniti, for her sweetness and support
throughout.
</p><!--  l. 14  --><p class="indent">       Like the universe, my journey in high energy physics (HEP) began with a bang:
the CERN Openlab summer student program. It was a breathtaking experience, and I
am grateful to Cliff, Frank, and my supervisor Maurizio for their support then
                                                                                

                                                                                
and throughout my career since. Maurizio, in particular, introduced me to the
(Nobel-prize winning!) potential of AI in HEP, and I have been hooked ever
since.
</p><!--  l. 18  --><p class="indent">       More importantly, he introduced me to Javier right as we were both, perhaps
serendipitously, joining UCSD in the Fall of 2019. Javier has been the most brilliant,
kind, and supportive advisor I could have asked for, and I thank him for teaching me a
lot more than just physics. Along with him, I thank many awesome postdocs and
scientists, including Cristina, Daniel, Nhan, Petar, and Si for their mentorship through
the years.
</p><!--  l. 22  --><p class="indent">       Parts <a href="TheoreticalBackground.html#theoretical-background">I<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:sm   --></a>—<a href="AIMLandStatisticsBackground.html#aiml-and-statistics-background">III<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:aiml   --></a> are primarily original work for this dissertation, discussing the
standard model, the CMS experiment and the LHC, AI and ML, and statistics, and
building on several references listed therein. On the topic of statistics, I thank Javier
and Nick Smith for countless discussions (as well as their much-needed help with
analysis software and the CMS combine tool)!
</p><!--  l. 25  --><p class="indent">       Part <a href="AcceleratingSimulationswithAI.html#accelerating-simulations-with-ai">IV<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:ml4sim   --></a> presents novel methods for producing and validating fast simulations of
the CMS detector using AI. I thank Maurizio for introducing me to this topic as a
summer student and his guidance since, and Javier for supporting this work, and all the
research directions it bloomed, since the beginning of my PhD. I also thank my fellow
students on the topic, Mary and Breno; Nadya for her support during my time at
CERN; Kevin Pedro for lending his expertise on CMS simulations; and the
IRIS-HEP institute and the Fermilab LPC for supporting this work through the
IRIS-HEP fellowship and the LPC AI fellowship and graduate scholarship,
                                                                                

                                                                                
respectively.

channel using data collected by the CMS experiment during Run 2 of the LHC. I thank
Cristina for her hands-on guidance on both the physics and technical aspects from the
start and her patience as I refactored our codebase every week. I thank as well Javier,
Petar, Si, and the rest of our boosted double-Higgs working group, as well as Nhan and
the DASZLE team, for their advice and support. I thank finally Nick, Lindsey, and all
the Coffea and Scikit-HEP developers for building a wonderful and supportive Pythonic
HEP ecosystem.

opportunities.
