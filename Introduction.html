<!--  l. 24  --><p class="indent">       The universe started with a bang. A massive burst of energy, temperature, and
pressure, with all four fundamental forces — electromagnetism, nuclear weak, nuclear strong,
and gravity — as one. Immediately after, the universe expanded and cooled, and after about

later, the strong force separated as well and finally, by around

did the weak and electromagnetic forces,“turning on” the Higgs field in the process and
leaving us with the fundamental forces and laws of physics as we know them today
(Figure <a href="#the-timeline-and-evolution-of-forces-in-the-early-universe">1<!--  tex4ht:ref: fig:00_timeline   --></a>).
</p><!--  l. 29  --><p class="indent">       Electromagnetism, the nuclear weak and strong forces, the Higgs field, and all
known elementary particles can be elegantly described by the standard model (SM) of
particle physics. Over the last 60 years, it has proven a monumentally successful theory,
both explaining and predicting physical phenomena up to energies produced naturally
only within a nanosecond of the Big Bang. These include the prediction of the Higgs
boson 50 years before its discovery, explanations for radioactive decay and the binding
of atomic nuclei, and the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces. However,
despite its triumphs, there remain fundamental mysteries that the SM cannot
explain.
</p><!--  l. 34  --><p class="indent">       The most glaring of these is its reconciliation, or lack thereof, with gravity, for
which a quantum, SM-compatible theory has proven elusive. There is also abundant
                                                                                

                                                                                
cosmological evidence of “dark” matter and energy, constituting 95% of the universe and
yet finding no justification from the SM. Other subtle mysteries include the
inconsistency between the matter-antimatter <i>a</i>symmetry we observe and the
symmetry the SM predicts, the mechanism for neutrino masses, and the origin of
flavor.
</p><!--  l. 38  --><p class="indent">       The work in this dissertation is motivated by the strong possibility of many of
the answers being tied to the Higgs boson. It is our newest discovered and least
understood elementary particle, and the unique nature of the Higgs field and
its interactions leaves open vast potential for intriguing new physics in this
sector. As electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e., the separation of the weak
and electromagnetic forces, is intimately connected to a phase transition of
the Higgs field, many theories naturally link this transition with the breaking
of the matter-antimatter [<a href="Bibliography.html#XMorrissey_2012">64</a>] and flavor symmetries [<a href="Bibliography.html#XBAZZOCCHI2005372">65</a>] as well. The Higgs
boson may also be the connection between the SM and the dark sector [<a href="Bibliography.html#Xsym13122406">66</a>],
while the “Higgs-Saw” [<a href="Bibliography.html#XKrauss_2013oea">67</a>] mechanism is a promising explanation for dark
energy.
</p><!--  l. 44  --><p class="indent">       Predictions of these theories include new, rare, Higgs-like particles and/or minute
deviations to the interactions of the Higgs boson from the SM. However, as many of the
phenomena therein would have occurred during the electroweak epoch or earlier (see
Figure <a href="#the-timeline-and-evolution-of-forces-in-the-early-universe">1<!--  tex4ht:ref: fig:00_timeline   --></a>), these effects would manifest only at the highest energies, comparable to that
of <!--  l. 45  --><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow> <mo class="MathClass-rel" stretchy="false">&lt;</mo> <mn>1</mn></mrow></math>ps
after the Big Bang. This dissertation presents two complementary efforts to
                                                                                

                                                                                
probe such effects, by (1) searching for new, highly energetic Higgs bosons,
and (2) measuring Higgs interactions uniquely sensitive to new, high energy
physics.
</p><!--  l. 48  --><p class="indent">       We do so using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC
accelerates and collides extremely high-speed protons, producing energies comparable to
the early universe just 10ps after the Big Bang. We observe these collisions with the
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of four massive detectors at the LHC,
and one of the two that discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. Crucially, we emphasize
that, with the exponentially increasing rate of collisions and data at the LHC, the
CMS experiment is entering an era of unprecedented potential for scientific
discovery.
</p><!--  l. 53  --><p class="indent">       To fully realize this, however, and maximize the impact of our new data,
significant computational innovation is required. To this end, we also present in this
dissertation several novel AI techniques to identify high energy Higgs bosons, accelerate
simulations of the CMS detector, and complement traditional data analysis techniques
with model-agnostic searches for new physics. Particular emphasis is placed on the
development of physics-informed machine learning (ML) algorithms, which
uniquely leverage biases of high energy physics (HEP) data to improve their
performance and robustness. Namely, we introduce the first generative models for
<i>point-cloud</i> data in HEP, which respect the sparsity and high granularity of
detector data, and the first anomaly detection models equivariant to Lorentz
transformations.
                                                                                

                                                                                
</p><!--  l. 58  --><p class="indent">       We also describe significant efforts towards <i>validating</i> such AI techniques, which
is critical for them to ultimately have an impact in the field. Specifically, we apply a
novel method for calibrating ML algorithms targeting Higgs to vector boson decays,
which has proven effective not only for the analyses presented in this dissertation but for
the broader CMS physics program as well. We additionally present several studies and
new statistical techniques for evaluating fast simulations. The combination of these and
our new AI models has the potential to revolutionize the computing paradigm in
CMS, improving the computational efficiency of our simulations by up to three
orders of magnitude, and ensuring trust in their modeling of the underlying
physics.
</p><!--  l. 64  --><p class="indent">       This dissertation is organized as follows. Part <a href="TheoreticalBackground.html#theoretical-background">I<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:sm   --></a> introduces the theoretical basis
for this dissertation, starting with the mathematical framework behind symmetries in
physics (Chapter <a href="Symmetriesinphysics.html#symmetries-in-physics">2<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:01_symmetries   --></a>) and of quantum field theory (Chapter <a href="Quantumfieldtheory.html#quantum-field-theory">3<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:01_qft   --></a>) before detailing the SM of
particle physics (Chapter <a href="TheStandardModelofParticlePhysics.html#the-standard-model-of-particle-physics">4<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:01_sm   --></a>). Part <a href="ExperimentalBackground.html#experimental-background">II<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:epp   --></a> then describes the experimental apparatus used in
this dissertation: the LHC (Chapter <a href="TheCERNLargeHadronCollider.html#the-cern-large-hadron-collider">5<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:02_lhc   --></a>) and the CMS experiment (Chapter <a href="TheCMSdetector.html#the-cms-detector">6<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:02_cms   --></a>).

well as the data analysis and statistical framework used in this dissertation
(Chapter <a href="DataAnalysisandStatisticalInterpretation.html#data-analysis-and-statistical-interpretation">8<!--  tex4ht:ref: sec:03_stats   --></a>).

Part <a href="AcceleratingSimulationswithAI.html#accelerating-simulations-with-ai">IV<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:ml4sim   --></a>
presents new methods for producing and validating fast simulations of the CMS detector
using ML, which will be critical to maximizing the scientific output of the LHC in the
coming decade. These methods leverage advancements in generative modeling to develop
                                                                                

                                                                                
novel, physics-informed simulation techniques that are orders of magnitude
faster than traditional methods. We also discuss new techniques for robust
evaluation of such fast simulation techniques, and the outlook for their use in
CMS.
</p><!--  l. 75  --><p class="indent">       Part <a href="SearchesforHighEnergyHiggsBosonPairs.html#searches-for-high-energy-higgs-boson-pairs">V<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:hh   --></a> then presents two novel searches to understand the high energy Higgs
sector of the SM, targeting the production of Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson pairs, which
decay into two beauty quarks and two vector bosons. Such searches are critical to
understanding the properties of the Higgs boson and searching for the effects of
new physics at very high energies. We discuss the analysis techniques used in
these searches, particularly the use of deep transformer networks to identify
Higgs-boson decays to two vector bosons for the first time, and competitive
constraints achieved on new physics models and the two-Higgs-two-vector-boson
coupling.
</p><!--  l. 79  --><p class="indent">       Finally, Part <a href="AIforJets.html#ai-for-jets">VI<!--  tex4ht:ref: part:ml4jets   --></a> outlines the development of new software to facilitate research
in ML and HEP and ML techniques that respect the symmetries of the high
energy collisions that we study. Namely, we introduce the <span class="small-caps">JetNet</span> Python
package, which has proven impactful in this field, and a novel ML algorithm for
searching for new physics while remaining robust to Lorentz-transformations of our
data.
